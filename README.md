# Rosalind
Solutions to various Rosalind problems in C#. This was before I started in Python, 
and as such I was mostly doing this for learning proramming via problem solving.
I was told to start in C# for working towards robot integrations, but I now have 
switched to a more data science oriented focus. This is now deprecated, but involved
writing a fasta parser, easy file selection, and building upon past projects. This was
done over the course of my first 2 months learning programming.
